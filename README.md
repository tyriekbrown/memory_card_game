# memory_card_game
i worked on this project with the intentions of making a bigger selection. works fine but now for the real deal.
My Awesome Project

I worked on this as a learning tool to build another game with more cards and colors. 
Lessons Learned: Pretty much was just having fun with this and for loops.
